# Lab 2

* Project Overview: Email Spam Classification

For this lab, I have selected the Email/SMS Spam Collection dataset to address the growing issue of unsolicited electronic communications.

1. Problem Definition

Problem Type: Binary Classification (Supervised Learning).

Objective: To build a model that can accurately distinguish between "Spam" (unsolicited/malicious) and "Ham" (legitimate) messages based on their textual content.

Target Variable: label or class (Categorical: Spam vs. Ham).

2. Dataset Information

Source: [Kaggle / UCI Machine Learning Repository]

Format: CSV

Description: The dataset contains a collection of raw messages tagged according to whether they are legitimate or spam.

3. Methodology Diagram

The following diagram illustrates the end-to-end workflow adopted for this project:

Note: The workflow includes Data Collection, Text Preprocessing (Tokenization & Vectorization), Train/Test Splitting, Model Selection (Naïve Bayes, Random Forest), and Evaluation via Accuracy and Precision.
